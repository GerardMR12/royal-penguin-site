  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 5, 2025<br />
     <strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> (the “App”), provided by <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle any personal or usage data. 
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> is a backend-less, client-only mobile application that allows users to build and spin customizable wheels entirely on their own device.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> does <em>not</em> collect, transmit, store, or share any personal information, usage statistics, or device identifiers. All functionality takes place locally on your device. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not ask for or store your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifying information.</li>
    <li><strong>No Usage Analytics:</strong> We do not include analytics SDKs or libraries. We do not track how you use the App, how often you open it, or what options you select on your wheel.</li>
    <li><strong>No Crash Reporting:</strong> There is no crash-reporting service active; any unexpected failures remain solely on your device and are not transmitted anywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>No Third-Party Services:</strong> The App does not integrate with advertising networks, cloud services, or any remote backends. All data resides on your mobile phone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> is a standalone application that does not request any permissions beyond what is strictly required for your device to render the user interface. In particular:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Internet Permission:</strong> Because there is no backend or remote service, the App does not require internet access or network permissions.</li>
    <li><strong>No Storage or Media Permissions:</strong> The App does not read or write to external storage or the photo library. All wheel data is stored internally within the App’s sandbox on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Since <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> does not collect or store any data beyond what you explicitly enter in each session, there is no data retention policy to describe. Any wheel you create remains on your device only as long as you keep the App installed. Uninstalling the App or clearing its data will remove all saved wheels.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). Because the App does not gather personal data of any kind, no special process is required. Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise children’s use of any mobile application.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we ever introduce any features that collect data (for example, analytics, crash reporting, or cloud backup), we will revise this document to describe what we collect and how it is used. Your continued use of <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> after any changes to this policy indicates your acceptance of those changes.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. By including AdMob, we allow Google to collect certain device and usage information to serve, measure, and improve ads:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Collected by Google AdMob:</strong>  
      Google may collect information such as your device’s Advertising ID (e.g. IDFA on iOS or AAID on Android), IP address, device model, operating system version, and coarse location (if you have granted location permissions to this device). AdMob also gathers usage signals—like which ads you click, what apps you have installed, and when you open the app—to personalize ads and prevent fraud.
    </li>
    <li><strong>How Google Uses This Data:</strong>  
      Google uses the collected information to deliver tailored advertising (based on your inferred interests), cap the frequency of ads, combat invalid traffic (fraud), and measure ad performance. We do not share additional personal information with Google beyond what the AdMob SDK collects.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Opting Out of Personalized Ads:</strong>  
      If you wish to opt out of personalized advertising, you can:
      <ul>
        <li>On Android: Open your device’s Settings → Google → Ads → Enable “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”</li>
        <li>On iOS: Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking → Toggle off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.”</li>
      </ul>
      Alternatively, you can visit Google’s Ads Settings page:  
      <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://adssettings.google.com</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>EEA Users (GDPR Compliance):</strong>  
      If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> will prompt you for consent—via Google’s User Messaging Platform or a similar “consent‐dialogue” mechanism—before serving any personalized ads. You may adjust your choices at any time through the consent interface provided within the app.
    </li>
  </ul>
