  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 12, 2025
  </p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> (the “App”), provided by <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> (“we,” “us,”
    or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle any personal or usage data.
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> is a backend-less, client-only mobile application that allows users to build and
    spin customizable wheels entirely on their own device.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Handle Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Our philosophy is to process as little data as possible. This section clarifies what data is processed locally by
    the app versus what is processed by our required service partners.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Processed Locally on Your Device</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> does not require you to create an account or provide us with any personal
    information like your name or email address. Any text you enter for the wheel options is stored only on your device
    and is not transmitted to us or any third party.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Processed by Our Partners</h3>
  <p>
    To support our app, we integrate with Google AdMob to show advertisements. This service collects data automatically
    for its core functions. For a detailed breakdown of what our advertising partner collects and how it is used, please
    see the <strong>Advertising</strong> section of this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> is designed to be minimally intrusive. It only uses permissions required for its
    core features and to support advertising.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet Permission:</strong> Internet access is required by our advertising partner, Google AdMob, to
      retrieve and display advertisements. The app does not use this permission for any other purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>No Storage or Media Permissions:</strong> The App does not read or write to your device's external
      storage or access your photo library. All wheel data is stored internally within the App’s sandboxed data folder.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Since <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> does not collect or store any data beyond what you explicitly enter in
    each session, there is no data retention policy to describe. Any wheel you create remains on your device only as
    long as you keep the App installed. Uninstalling the App or clearing its data will remove all saved wheels.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This app does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or
    the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). Because the App does not gather personal data of any kind, no
    special process is required. Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise children’s use of any mobile
    application.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we ever introduce any features that collect data (for
    example, analytics, crash reporting, or cloud backup), we will revise this document to describe what we collect and
    how it is used. Your continued use of <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> after any changes to this policy indicates
    your acceptance of those changes.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    This app is supported by advertising, which allows us to offer it for free. We partner with third-party advertising
    networks to display ads within the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our primary advertising partner is Google AdMob. We encourage you to review their policies to understand how they
    collect and use your data. For more information, please see <strong><a
        href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Google uses
        data when you use our partners' sites or apps</a></strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Collected by Our Advertising Partner</h3>
  <p>
    To provide personalized and relevant advertising, Google AdMob may collect and process certain information,
    including but not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Your device's advertising ID (IDFA for iOS or AAID for Android), IP
      address, device make and model, operating system, and language settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> Your interactions with ads shown in the app, such as clicks and views.</li>
    <li><strong>Coarse Location Information:</strong> Non-precise location inferred from your IP address or device
      settings, if location services are enabled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How This Data Is Used</h3>
  <p>
    The data collected is used by our advertising partner for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To serve and personalize advertisements.</li>
    <li>To measure the performance and effectiveness of ads.</li>
    <li>To prevent fraud and ensure the security of their advertising services.</li>
    <li>To limit the number of times you see the same ad.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Managing Your Advertising Preferences</h3>
  <p>
    You have control over the collection and use of your data for personalized advertising.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>For Users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland:</strong> We will display a consent form from Google before
      showing personalized ads. You can accept or decline consent, and you can change your choices at any time from
      within the app by navigating to <code>Preferences → Change Privacy Preferences</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Opting Out on Your Device:</strong> All users can limit ad tracking or opt out of personalized
      advertising through their device settings:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On Android:</strong> Navigate to <code>Settings > Google > Ads</code> and select "Delete advertising
          ID".</li>
        <li><strong>On iOS:</strong> Navigate to <code>Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking</code> and disable
          "Allow Apps to Request to Track" for this app.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
