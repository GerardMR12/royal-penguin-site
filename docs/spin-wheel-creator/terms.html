  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 12, 2025
  </p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Spin Wheel Creator</strong> (the “App”), provided by <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the App, which is a backend-less mobile application that allows users to create and spin customizable wheels locally on their device. By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
  <p>
    Subject to your compliance with these Terms, <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App on your mobile device for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not redistribute, sublicense, or otherwise make the App available to any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permitted Use and Restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. Specifically, you must not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.</li>
    <li>Modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the App.</li>
    <li>Use the App to create content that is illegal, defamatory, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
    <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the App.</li>
    <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. App Functionality and Data</h2>
  <p>
    The App operates entirely on your device; there is no backend server or external database. Any wheel designs, labels, or configurations you create are stored locally within the App sandbox on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your wheel data or personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All intellectual property rights in and to the App, including but not limited to text, images, graphics, logos, and code, are owned by <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> or its licensors. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by downloading or using the App.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Content</h2>
  <p>
    The App may include or provide access to third-party content (e.g., icon libraries or fonts). Any use of third-party content is subject to that third party’s terms and conditions. We are not responsible for any third-party offerings.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without cause, including if we believe you have violated these Terms. Upon termination, your license to use the App will immediately cease, and you must delete all copies of the App from your device.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Disclaimer of Warranties:</strong><br />
    The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong><br />
    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall <strong>Royal Penguin</strong>, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of, or inability to use, the App, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, loss of goodwill, or any other intangible losses. Our total aggregate liability for all claims related to the App shall not exceed fifty U.S. dollars (USD $50).
  </p>

  <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the App or any violation of these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may modify or update these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by other reasonable means. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for updates.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the App shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Madrid, Spain.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Severability</h2>
  <p>
    If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be severed, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms, together with any other policies referenced herein (e.g., Privacy Policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and <strong>Royal Penguin</strong> regarding the App and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, representations, and agreements.
